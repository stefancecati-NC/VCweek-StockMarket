## 🧹 Repository Cleanup & Deployment

This branch (`cleanup-and-deploy`) addresses several repository maintenance issues and sets up automated deployment.

### ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **Removed `node_modules` from tracking**: The `node_modules` folder was accidentally committed to the repository, making it unnecessarily large.
2. **Added proper `.gitignore`**: Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent future accidental commits of dependencies, logs, and other files.
3. **Set up GitHub Actions**: Added automated deployment workflow for GitHub Pages.

### 🚀 Deployment Setup

The repository now includes:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Automatically builds and deploys the app to GitHub Pages
- **Build Script**: Added `npm run build` command that prepares the static files for deployment
- **Clean Git History**: Removed all unnecessary files from version control

### 📋 To Complete Deployment

1. **Merge this branch to main**:
   ```bash
   # Switch to main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Merge the cleanup branch
   git merge cleanup-and-deploy
   
   # Push to trigger deployment
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Save the settings

3. **Your app will be available at**:
   ```
   https://stefancecati-NC.github.io/VCweek-StockMarket
   ```

### 📝 Notes

- The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run on every push to the `main` branch
- The deployment creates a static version of your app from the `public` folder
- For full functionality with live data, you'll need to deploy the backend server separately (consider services like Heroku, Railway, or Vercel)

### 🔧 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 🌐 Live Demo

Once deployed, your app will be accessible at: `https://stefancecati-NC.github.io/VCweek-StockMarket`

**Next Steps**: Merge this branch to `main` and enable GitHub Pages in repository settings to complete the deployment setup.
